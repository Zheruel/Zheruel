Hi! I'm a full stack software engineer currently working as a team lead on various important projects.

I used to have a great interest in breaking things and finding exploits, but have mostly been focused on building projects and teaching people best practices for the past few years.

I'm a big believer in clean code and quality-focused engineering principles that can carry over across different technologies.
